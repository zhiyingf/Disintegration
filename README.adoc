# Introduction
The code is used for component segmentation of http://irc.cs.sdu.edu.cn/~yunhai/public_html/ssl/ssd.htm[the shape COSEG Dataset] with component labels, and then the segmented components are filled with holes, so as to get water-tight data set components.  

# Compiling the code
The code only dependancies are https://github.com/libigl/libigl[libigl] and http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page[Eigen]. Both of which are included within this repository. We use CMake for building. If on Linux or OS X, you can build it in the terminal by doing something like:
[source,shell]
----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
----
If on Windows, create a `build/` folder, and run `cmake ..` from inside that folder. This will create a visual studio solution(if you have visual studio). Launch that solution, and then simply compile the project named `Disintegration`.
